  Starting from a Yang-Mills-Dirac theory defined in ten dimensions we classify
  the semi-realistic particle physics models resulting from their Forgacs-Manton
  dimensional reduction. The higher-dimensional gauge group is chosen to be E8.
  This choice as well as the dimensionality of the space-time is suggested by the
  heterotic string theory. Furthermore, we assume that the space-time on which the
  theory is defined can be written in the compactified form M4 Ã— B, with M4 the
  ordinary Minkowski spacetime and B = S/R a 6 - dim homogeneous coset space. We
  constrain our investigation in those cases where the dimensional reduction leads
  in four dimensions to phenomenologically interesting and anomaly-free GUTs such
  as E6, SO(10) and SU(5). However the four-dimensional surviving scalars
  transform in the fundamental of the resulting gauge group are not suitable for
  the superstrong symmetry breaking of the Standard Model. The main objective of
  our work is the investigation to which extent the latter can be achieved by
  employing the Wilson flux breaking mechanism.
