  Classification of imbalanced datasets is a challenging task for standard
  algorithms. Although many methods exist to address this problem in different
  ways, generating artificial data for the minority class is a more general
  approach compared to algorithmic modifications. SMOTE algorithm, as well as any
  other oversampling method based on the SMOTE mechanism, generates synthetic
  samples along line segments that join minority class instances. In this paper we
  propose Geometric SMOTE (G-SMOTE) as a enhancement of the SMOTE data generation
  mechanism. G-SMOTE generates synthetic samples in a geometric region of the
  input space, around each selected minority instance. While in the basic
  configuration this region is a hyper-sphere, G-SMOTE allows its deformation to a
  hyper-spheroid. The performance of G-SMOTE is compared against SMOTE as well as
  baseline methods. We present empirical results that show a significant
  improvement in the quality of the generated data when G-SMOTE is used as an
  oversampling algorithm. An implementation of G-SMOTE is made available in the
  Python programming language.
