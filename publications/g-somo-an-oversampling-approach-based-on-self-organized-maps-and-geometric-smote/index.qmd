  Traditional supervised machine learning classifiers are challenged to learn
  highly skewed data distributions as they are designed to expect classes to
  equally contribute to the minimization of the classifiers cost function.
  Moreover, the classifiers design expects equal misclassification costs, causing
  a bias for overrepresented classes. Different strategies have been proposed to
  correct this issue. The modification of the data set has become a common
  practice since the procedure is generalizable to all classifiers. Various
  algorithms to rebalance the data distribution through the creation of synthetic
  instances were proposed in the past. In this paper, we propose a new
  oversampling algorithm named G-SOMO. The algorithm identifies optimal areas to
  create artificial data instances in an informed manner and utilizes a geometric
  region during the data generation process to increase their variability. Our
  empirical results on 69 datasets, validated with different classifiers and
  metrics against a benchmark of commonly used oversampling methods show that
  G-SOMO consistently outperforms competing oversampling methods. Additionally,
  the statistical significance of our results is established.
