  Learning from imbalanced datasets is challenging for standard algorithms, as
  they are designed to work with balanced class distributions. Although there are
  different strategies to tackle this problem, methods that address the problem
  through the generation of artificial data constitute a more general approach
  compared to algorithmic modifications. Specifically, they generate artificial
  data that can be used by any algorithm, not constraining the options of the
  user. In this paper, we present a new oversampling method, Self-Organizing
  Map-based Oversampling (SOMO), which through the application of a
  Self-Organizing Map produces a two dimensional representation of the input
  space, allowing for an effective generation of artificial data points. SOMO
  comprises three major stages: Initially a Self-Organizing Map produces a
  two-dimensional representation of the original, usually high-dimensional, space.
  Next it generates within-cluster synthetic samples and finally it generates
  between cluster synthetic samples. Additionally we present empirical results
  that show the improvement in the performance of algorithms, when artificial data
  generated by SOMO are used, and also show that our method outperforms various
  oversampling methods.
