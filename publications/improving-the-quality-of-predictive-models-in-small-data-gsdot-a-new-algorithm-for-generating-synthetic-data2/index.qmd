  In the age of the data deluge there are still many domains and applications
  restricted to the use of small datasets. The ability to harness these small
  datasets to solve problems through the use of supervised learning methods can
  have a significant impact in many important areas. The insufficient size of
  training data usually results in unsatisfactory performance of machine learning
  algorithms. The current research work aims to contribute to mitigate the small
  data problem through the creation of artificial instances, which are added to
  the training process. The proposed algorithm, Geometric Small Data Oversampling
  Technique, uses geometric regions around existing samples to generate new high
  quality instances. Experimental results show a significant improvement in
  accuracy when compared with the use of the initial small dataset as well as
  other popular artificial data generation techniques.
