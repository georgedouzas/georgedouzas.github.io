  In remote sensing, Active Learning (AL) has become an important technique to
  collect informative ground truth data “on-demand” for supervised classification
  tasks. Despite its effectiveness, it is still significantly reliant on user
  interaction, which makes it both expensive and time consuming to implement. Most
  of the current literature focuses on the optimization of AL by modifying the
  selection criteria and the classifiers used. Although improvements in these
  areas will result in more effective data collection, the use of artificial data
  sources to reduce human–computer interaction remains unexplored. In this paper,
  we introduce a new component to the typical AL framework, the data generator, a
  source of artificial data to reduce the amount of user-labeled data required in
  AL. The implementation of the proposed AL framework is done using Geometric
  SMOTE as the data generator. We compare the new AL framework to the original one
  using similar acquisition functions and classifiers over three AL-specific
  performance metrics in seven benchmark datasets. We show that this modification
  of the AL framework significantly reduces cost and time requirements for a
  successful AL implementation in all of the datasets used in the experiment.
