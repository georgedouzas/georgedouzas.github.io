  Learning from class-imbalanced data continues to be a common and challenging
  problem in supervised learning as standard classification algorithms are
  designed to handle balanced class distributions. While different strategies
  exist to tackle this problem, methods which generate artificial data to achieve
  a balanced class distribution are more versatile than modifications to the
  classification algorithm. Such techniques, called oversamplers, modify the
  training data, allowing any classifier to be used with class-imbalanced
  datasets. Many algorithms have been proposed for this task, but most are complex
  and tend to generate unnecessary noise. This work presents a simple and
  effective oversampling method based on k-means clustering and SMOTE (synthetic
  minority oversampling technique), which avoids the generation of noise and
  effectively overcomes imbalances between and within classes. Empirical results
  of extensive experiments with 90 datasets show that training data oversampled
  with the proposed method improves classification results. Moreover, k-means
  SMOTE consistently outperforms other popular oversampling methods. An
  implementation1 is made available in the Python programming language.
