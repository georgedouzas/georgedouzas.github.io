  Learning from imbalanced datasets is a frequent but challenging task for
  standard classification algorithms. Although there are different strategies to
  address this problem, methods that generate artificial data for the minority
  class constitute a more general approach compared to algorithmic modifications.
  Standard oversampling methods are variations of the SMOTE algorithm, which
  generates synthetic samples along the line segment that joins minority class
  samples. Therefore, these approaches are based on local information, rather on
  the overall minority class distribution. Contrary to these algorithms, in this
  paper the conditional version of Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) is used
  to approximate the true data distribution and generate data for the minority
  class of various imbalanced datasets. The performance of cGAN is compared
  against multiple standard oversampling algorithms. We present empirical results
  that show a significant improvement in the quality of the generated data when
  cGAN is used as an oversampling algorithm.
