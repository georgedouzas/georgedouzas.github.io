abstract: >
  We consider a N=1 supersymmetric E 8 gauge theory, defined in ten dimensions and
  we determine all four-dimensional gauge theories resulting from the generalized
  dimensional reduction à la Forgacs–Manton over coset spaces, followed by a
  subsequent application of the Wilson flux spontaneous symmetry-breaking
  mechanism. Our investigation is constrained only by the requirements that (i)
  the dimensional reduction leads to the potentially phenomenologically
  interesting, anomaly-free, four-dimensional E 6, SO10 and SU5 GUTs and (ii) the
  Wilson flux mechanism makes use only of the freely acting discrete symmetries
  of all possible six-dimensional coset spaces.
