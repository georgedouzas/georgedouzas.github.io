abstract: >
  The automatic production of land use/land cover maps continues to be a
  challenging problem, with important impacts on the ability to promote
  sustainability and good resource management. The ability to build robust
  automatic classifiers and produce accurate maps can have a significant impact
  on the way we manage and optimize natural resources. The difficulty in
  achieving these results comes from many different factors, such as data
  quality and uncertainty. In this paper, we address the imbalanced learning
  problem, a common and difficult conundrum in remote sensing that affects the
  quality of classification results, by proposing Geometric-SMOTE, a novel
  oversampling method, as a tool for addressing the imbalanced learning problem
  in remote sensing. Geometric-SMOTE is a sophisticated oversampling algorithm
  which increases the quality of the instances generated in previous methods,
  such as the synthetic minority oversampling technique. The performance of
  Geometric-SMOTE, in the LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey) dataset, is
  compared to other oversamplers using a variety of classifiers. The results
  show that Geometric-SMOTE significantly outperforms all the other oversamplers
  and improves the robustness of the classifiers. These results indicate that,
  when using imbalanced datasets, remote sensing researchers should consider the
  use of these new generation oversamplers to increase the quality of the
  classification results.
