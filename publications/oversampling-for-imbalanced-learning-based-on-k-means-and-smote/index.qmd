  Learning from class-imbalanced data continues to be a common and challenging
  problem in supervised learning as standard classification algorithms are
  designed to handle balanced class distributions. While different strategies
  exist to tackle this problem, methods which generate artificial data to
  achieve a balanced class distribution are more versatile than modifications to
  the classification algorithm. Such techniques, called oversamplers, modify the
  training data, allowing any classifier to be used with class-imbalanced
  datasets. Many algorithms have been proposed for this task, but most are
  complex and tend to generate unnecessary noise. This work presents a simple
  and effective oversampling method based on k-means clustering and SMOTE
  oversampling, which avoids the generation of noise and effectively overcomes
  imbalances between and within classes. Empirical results of extensive
  experiments with 71 datasets show that training data oversampled with the
  proposed method improves classification results. Moreover, k-means SMOTE
  consistently outperforms other popular oversampling methods. An implementation
  is made available in the python programming language.
