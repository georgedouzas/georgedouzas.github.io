  Land cover maps are a critical tool to support informed policy development,
  planning, and resource management decisions. With significant upsides, the
  automatic production of Land Use/Land Cover maps has been a topic of interest
  for the remote sensing community for several years, but it is still fraught with
  technical challenges. One such challenge is the imbalanced nature of most
  remotely sensed data. The asymmetric class distribution impacts negatively the
  performance of classifiers and adds a new source of error to the production of
  these maps. In this paper, we address the imbalanced learning problem, by using
  K-means and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) as an improved
  oversampling algorithm. K-means SMOTE improves the quality of newly created
  artificial data by addressing both the between-class imbalance, as traditional
  oversamplers do, but also the within-class imbalance, avoiding the generation of
  noisy data while effectively overcoming data imbalance. The performance of
  K-means SMOTE is compared to three popular oversampling methods (Random
  Oversampling, SMOTE and Borderline-SMOTE) using seven remote sensing benchmark
  datasets, three classifiers (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random
  Forest Classifier) and three evaluation metrics using a five-fold
  cross-validation approach with three different initialization seeds. The
  statistical analysis of the results show that the proposed method consistently
  outperforms the remaining oversamplers producing higher quality land cover
  classifications. These results suggest that LULC data can benefit significantly
  from the use of more sophisticated oversamplers as spectral signatures for the
  same class can vary according to geographical distribution.
