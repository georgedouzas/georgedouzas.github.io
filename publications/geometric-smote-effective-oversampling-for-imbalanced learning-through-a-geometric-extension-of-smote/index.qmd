  Classification of imbalanced datasets is a challenging task for standard
  algorithms. Although many methods exist to address this problem in different
  ways, generating artificial data for the minority class is a more general
  approach compared to algorithmic modifications. SMOTE algorithm and its
  variations generate synthetic samples along a line segment that joins minority
  class instances. In this paper we propose Geometric SMOTE (G-SMOTE) as a
  generalization of the SMOTE data generation mechanism. G-SMOTE generates
  synthetic samples in a geometric region of the input space, around each selected
  minority instance. While in the basic configuration this region is a
  hyper-sphere, G-SMOTE allows its deformation to a hyper-spheroid and finally to
  a line segment, emulating, in the last case, the SMOTE mechanism. The
  performance of G-SMOTE is compared against multiple standard oversampling
  algorithms. We present empirical results that show a significant improvement in
  the quality of the generated data when G-SMOTE is used as an oversampling
  algorithm.
