I work as a machine learning researcher at the Nova IMS, University of Lisbon. I am also a member
of the MagIC research and development center. My research areas are physics, mathematics and artificial
intelligence with multiple publications in machine learning and high energy physics journals. My
professional experience includes working for various companies as a software and machine learning
engineer. Additionally, I often maintain or contribute to open-source projects.
