# Introduction

It’s quite common to think of physical space as $\mathbb{R}^3$, but this perspective can be misleading, both from a mathematical
and a physical standpoint. The main issue is that the structure of $\mathbb{R}^3$ isn’t naturally invariant under displacements or
other critical transformations, known as isometries, which are fundamental to Euclidean geometry. Instead, the three-dimensional
space we encounter in Classical Physics (and even the four-dimensional spacetime in Special Relativity) is more accurately
captured by the concept of affine spaces.

# Affine spaces

To understand this better, let’s dive into what a real affine space is. A real affine space of finite dimension $n$, denoted by
$\mathbb{A}^n$, is a collection of elements known as points, but with some additional structure:

- There’s an associated $n$-dimensional vector space $V$, which we call the space of displacements or the space of free vectors.
- A mapping $\mathbb{A}^n \times \mathbb{A}^n \ni (P, Q) \mapsto P - Q \in V$ that respects certain conditions:
    - For every point $Q\in \mathbb{A}^n$ and every vector $\mathbf{v} \in V$, there’s a unique point $P \in \mathbb{A}^n$ such that $P - Q =
    \mathbf{v}$. 
    - For any three points $P, Q, R \in \mathbb{A}^n$, the equation $P - Q + Q - R = P - R$ always holds.

### Additional definitions

Let’s define a few useful concepts:

- Given a point $Q \in \mathbb{A}^n$ and a vector $\mathbf{v} \in V$, the unique point $P \in \mathbb{A}^n$ that satisfies $P - Q
= \mathbf{v}$ is denoted as $Q + \mathbf{v}$.
- A line in $\mathbb{A}^n$ originating from a point $P$ with direction given by a vector $\mathbf{v} \in V$ is described by the
map $\mathbb{R} \ni t \mapsto P + t\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{A}^n$.
- A line segment is simply a restriction of the above map to a specific interval.

### Properties

The following interesting properties hold for any points $P, Q \in \mathbb{A}^n$ and vectors $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V$:

- $P - P = \mathbf{0}$.
- $(Q + \mathbf{u}) + \mathbf{v} = Q + (\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v})$.
- $P - Q = -(Q - P)$.
- $P - Q = (P + \mathbf{u}) - (Q + \mathbf{u})$.

# Coordinate systems on affine spaces

Now that we’ve established what an affine space is, let’s discuss how we can introduce coordinate systems on such spaces. A local
coordinate system on an affine space $\mathbb{A}^n$ is a map $\psi: U \subset \mathbb{A}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ that
satisfies:

- The map $\psi$ is injective.
- The image $\psi(U)$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

If $U = \mathbb{A}^n$, we call the coordinate system global.

### Cartesian coordinate systems

Every affine space has a family of global coordinate systems known as Cartesian coordinate systems. To define one, we need to:

- Choose a point $O$ (the origin) and a basis $\mathbf{e}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_n$ for the vector space $V$.
- Define a map $f: \mathbb{A}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ by $f(P) = \left((P - O)^1, \ldots, (P - O)^n\right)$.

> Try proving that this map $f$ is bijective, which will confirm that $f$ is indeed a global coordinate system.

Non-Cartesian local coordinate systems, on the other hand, are referred to as curvilinear coordinate systems.

### Properties of Cartesian coordinate systems

Suppose we have two Cartesian coordinate systems: $\left(\mathbb{A}^n, f\right)$ with coordinates $x^1, \cdots, x^n$, and another
$\left(\mathbb{A}^n, g\right)$ with coordinates $x^{\prime 1}, \cdots, x^{\prime n}$, origin $O^{\prime}$, and basis vectors
$\mathbf{e}_1^{\prime}, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_n^{\prime}$. If the relation between the basis vectors is:

$$
\mathbf{e}_i = \sum_j B^j{}_i \mathbf{e}_j^{\prime}
$$

and $O - O^{\prime} = \sum_i b^i \mathbf{e}_i$, then the following properties hold:

- The transformation map $g \circ f^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is given by $x^{\prime j} = \sum_{i=1}^n
B^j{}_i\left(x^i + b^i\right)$.
- Conversely, the map $f \circ g^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is expressed as $x^i = -b^i +
\sum_{j=1}^n\left(B^{-1}\right)^i{}_j x^{\prime j}$.

> Again, try proving these transformations to see how coordinate systems relate to each other.

# Affine transformations between affine spaces

Let’s now explore how we can map one affine space to another. A map $\psi: \mathbb{A}_1^n \rightarrow \mathbb{A}_2^m$ between two
affine spaces, with associated vector spaces $V_1$ and $V_2$, is called an affine transformation if:

- The map $\psi$ is invariant under displacements, meaning that for any points $P, Q \in \mathbb{A}_1^n$ and any vector
$\mathbf{u} \in V_1$, the equality $\psi(P + \mathbf{u}) - \psi(Q + \mathbf{u}) = \psi(P) - \psi(Q)$ holds.
- The derivative map $d\psi: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$, defined by $d\psi(P - Q) = \psi(P) - \psi(Q)$, is a linear transformation
between the vector spaces $V_1$ and $V_2$.

> Proving that $d\psi$ is well-defined and linear will help you understand the relationship between these spaces.

### Isomorphism of affine spaces

An affine transformation $\psi: \mathbb{A}_1^n \rightarrow \mathbb{A}_2^m$ is called an isomorphism if it is bijective. This
concept is particularly important because it tells us when two affine spaces are structurally the same.

### Properties of affine transformations

Affine transformations have several key properties:

- The inverse of an isomorphism is itself an affine transformation, making it an isomorphism as well.
- If $\psi: \mathbb{A}_1^n \rightarrow \mathbb{A}_2^n$ is an isomorphism, then the derivative map $d\psi: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ is
a vector space isomorphism.
- Affine transformations map straight lines to straight lines. Specifically, if $P(t) := P + t \mathbf{u}$ describes a line in
$\mathbb{A}_1^n$, then $\psi(P(t))$ defines a line in $\mathbb{A}_2^m$.
- Given Cartesian coordinate systems on $\mathbb{A}_1^n$ and $\mathbb{A}_2^m$, the affine transformation $\psi$ has a particularly
simple form in these coordinates: $x_2^i = c^i + \sum_{j=1}^n L^i{}_j x_1^j$, where the coefficients $L^i{}_j$ and $c^i$ depend on
$\psi$ and the chosen coordinate systems.

> Proving these properties gives you a clearer view of how affine spaces relate to each other under transformations.

# Group of displacements of affine spaces

In the context of affine spaces, the concept of displacements is crucial. For a given vector $\mathbf{v} \in V$, we can define a
mapping $T_{\mathbf{v}}: \mathbb{A}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{A}^n$ that shifts every point $P$ in the affine space by $\mathbf{v}$.
Formally, this map is defined as $T_{\mathbf{v}}(P) = P + \mathbf{v}$. The collection of all such transformations, denoted
$\left\{T_{\mathbf{v}}\right\}_{\mathbf{v} \in V}$, forms what is known as the group of displacements of $\mathbb{A}^n$. This
group operates under the composition of mappings.

> To explore this concept further, you can try proving that the set $\left\{T_{\mathbf{v}}\right\}_{\mathbf{v} \in V}$ indeed
forms a group under composition.

### Properties

The group of displacements comes with several interesting properties:

- The group of displacements of $\mathbb{A}^n$ is abelian, meaning that the order in which you apply displacements doesn’t matter;
that is, $T_{\mathbf{v}} \circ T_{\mathbf{u}} = T_{\mathbf{u}} \circ T_{\mathbf{v}}$ for any vectors $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in
V$.
- The map $V \ni \mathbf{v} \mapsto T_{\mathbf{v}}$ is injective, which means that each vector $\mathbf{v}$ corresponds to a
unique transformation. Moreover, this mapping is a group isomorphism when $V$ is viewed as an abelian group under vector addition.
- Only the zero vector $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$ satisfies $T_{\mathbf{v}}(P) = P$ for some $P \in \mathbb{A}^n$. In fact, this
holds for every point $P$, so the action of the group of displacements is free.
- For any two points $P, Q \in \mathbb{A}^n$, there exists a displacement $T_{\mathbf{v}}$ such that $T_{\mathbf{v}}(P) = Q$. This
property highlights the fact that the group of displacements acts transitively on the affine space.

> These properties are foundational to understanding the structure of affine spaces. You might find it helpful to prove these
properties yourself.

### Group action

To generalize the idea of how a group can interact with a set, we use the concept of a group action. Let’s consider a set $S$ and
a group $G$ with a neutral element $e$ and a group operation $\circ$. A group action is a map $A: G \times S \ni (g, s) \mapsto
A_g(s) \in S$, where $A_g \in \mathcal{G}_S$ (the group of bijections on $S$ under composition). For this map to be a valid group
action, it must satisfy two key properties:

- The action of the neutral element is the identity: $A_e = \text{id}$.
- The action respects the group operation: $A_g \circ A_{g^{\prime}} = A_{g \circ g^{\prime}}$ for all $g, g^{\prime} \in G$.

There are a few special types of group actions that are worth noting:

- The action is called free if $A_g(s) = s$ for some $s \in S$ implies $g = e$.
- The action is transitive if for any two elements $s, s^{\prime} \in S$, there exists a group element $g \in G$ such that $A_g(s)
= s^{\prime}$.
- The action is faithful if the map $G \ni g \mapsto A_g \in \mathcal{G}_S$ is injective, meaning that different elements of $G$
induce different bijections on $S$.

Whenever we have a group action, it naturally defines a group homomorphism from $G$ to $\mathcal{G}_S$. The image of this
homomorphism, denoted $G_S = \left\{A_g\right\}_{g \in G}$, is a subgroup of $\mathcal{G}_S$. If the action is faithful, then this
homomorphism is actually an isomorphism between $G$ and $G_S$.

> To deepen your understanding, try proving the property that an action defines a group homomorphism and explore the implications
of free, transitive, and faithful actions.
