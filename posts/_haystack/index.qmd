[Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) is an open-source Python framework by deepset, tailored for developing custom NLP
applications using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. It facilitates seamless integration with various models from platforms
such as Hugging Face and OpenAI. Users can build diverse applications, from semantic searches to chatbots, using Haystack's
comprehensive tools that span model deployment, data preprocessing, and evaluation. Central to Haystack are its modular building
concepts, including components, pipelines, and agents, which offer both predefined and customizable functionalities. Designed for
both NLP experts and beginners, the framework's growth is supported by a robust open-source community that collaborates through
platforms like GitHub and Discord, and participates in various community events and webinars.
