# Introduction

It’s quite common to think of physical space as $\mathbb{R}^3$, but this
perspective can be misleading, both from a mathematical and a physical
standpoint. Instead, the three-dimensional space we encounter in Classical
Physics (and even the four-dimensional spacetime in Special Relativity) is more
accurately captured by the concept of affine spaces.

# Affine spaces

To understand this better, let’s dive into what a real affine space is. A real
affine space of finite dimension $n$, denoted by $\mathbb{A}^n$, is a collection
of elements known as points, but with some additional structure:

- There’s an associated $n$-dimensional vector space $V$, which we call the space of displacements or the space of free vectors.
- A mapping $\mathbb{A}^n \times \mathbb{A}^n \ni (P, Q) \mapsto P - Q \in V$ that respects certain conditions:
    - For every point $Q\in \mathbb{A}^n$ and every vector $\mathbf{v} \in V$, there’s a unique point $P \in \mathbb{A}^n$ such that $P - Q =\mathbf{v}$. 
    - For any three points $P, Q, R \in \mathbb{A}^n$, the equation $P - Q + Q - R = P - R$ always holds.

# Trivial example

A trivial affine space would be the real affine plane $\mathbb{A}^2 =
 \mathbb{R}^2$ with the displacement space being the vector space
 $\mathbb{R}^2$:

```{sage}
A = AffineSpace(2, RR)
A
```

We define two points of the affine space:

```{sage}
R = A.point([3.5, -4.6])
T = A.point([1.5, 0.6])
```

The affine space is not itself a vector space:

```{sage}
try:
    R + T
except TypeError:
    print('R and T points can not be added.')
```

We can displace the point $Q$ to a new point $P$ using the translation
$\mathbf{v} \in V$. Therefore $P = Q + \mathbf{v}$:

```{sage}
Q = A.point([1.0, 2.0])
v = vector([-1.0, 1.0])
P = A.translation(-v)(Q)
P
```

# Basic example

A less trivial example is the system $\begin{cases}x + y + z = 2 \\2x + y - z =
1\end{cases}$

```{sage}
a = matrix([[1,1,1], [2,1,-1]])
b = vector([2, 1])
```

The solution space of the system is an affine space $\mathbb{A}^3$:

```{sage}
A = AffineSpace(3, RR)
A
```

Additionally, the the solution space of the homogeneous system is the space of
displacements $V$:

```{sage}
V = VectorSpace(RR, 3).subspace(a.right_kernel().basis())
V
```

We can get a particular solution $Q \in \mathbb{A}^3$ and verify that it is
indeed a solution:

```{sage}
Q = A.point(tuple(a.solve_right(b)))
assert a * vector(Q) == b
Q
```

The general solution of the system is given by the displacement of $Q$. For
example another solution $P \in \mathbb{A}^3$ is the following:

```{sage}
v, *_ = V.basis()
P = A.translation(-v)(Q)
assert a * vector(P) == b
P
```
