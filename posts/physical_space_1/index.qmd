# Introduction

It’s quite common to think of physical space as $\mathbb{R}^3$, but this
perspective can be misleading, both from a mathematical and a physical
standpoint. Instead, the three-dimensional space we encounter in Classical
Physics (and even the four-dimensional spacetime in Special Relativity) is more
accurately captured by the concept of affine spaces.

# Definition

To understand this better, let’s dive into what a real affine space is. A real
affine space of finite dimension $n$, denoted by $\mathbb{A}^n$, is a collection
of elements known as points, but with some additional structure:

- There’s an associated $n$-dimensional vector space $V$, which we call the space of displacements or the space of free vectors.
- A mapping $\mathbb{A}^n \times \mathbb{A}^n \ni (P, Q) \mapsto P - Q \in V$ that respects certain conditions:
    - For every point $Q\in \mathbb{A}^n$ and every vector $\mathbf{v} \in V$, there’s a unique point $P \in \mathbb{A}^n$ such that $P - Q =\mathbf{v}$. 
    - For any three points $P, Q, R \in \mathbb{A}^n$, the equation $P - Q + Q - R = P - R$ always holds.

# Example

A trivial example is the real affine space $\mathbb{A}^n = \mathbb{R}^n$ with
 the displacement space being the vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$. A more
 interesting example is the system $\begin{cases}x + y + z = 2 \\2x + y - z =
 1\end{cases}$

```{sage}
a = matrix([[1,1,1], [2,1,-1]])
b = vector([2, 1])
```

The solution space of the system is an affine space $\mathbb{A}^3$:

```{sage}
A = AffineSpace(3, RR)
A
```

Additionally, the the solution space of the homogeneous system is the space of
displacements $V$:

```{sage}
V = VectorSpace(RR, 3).subspace(a.right_kernel().basis())
V
```

We can get a particular solution $Q \in \mathbb{A}^3$ and verify that it is
indeed a solution:

```{sage}
Q = A.point(tuple(a.solve_right(b)))
assert a * vector(Q) == b
Q
```

The general solution of the system is given by the displacement of $Q$. For
example another solution $P \in \mathbb{A}^3$ is the following:

```{sage}
v, *_ = V.basis()
P = A.translation(-v)(Q)
assert a * vector(P) == b
P
```
