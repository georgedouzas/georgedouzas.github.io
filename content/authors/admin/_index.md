I work as a machine learning researcher at the Nova University of Lisbon, School of Information Management. My research interests include physics, mathematics and artificial intelligence with various publications in machine learning and high energy physics journals. In the past, I have worked in multiple companies as a software and machine learning engineer. Additionally, I often contribute or maintain my own open source projects. Besides science, sports is my main hobby. Currently, my focus is in gymnastics and calisthenics while in the past I was a competitive sprinter.
