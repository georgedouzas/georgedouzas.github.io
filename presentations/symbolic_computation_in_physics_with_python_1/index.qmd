# Introduction

Symbolic computation simplifies complex equations and helps solve problems in
various fields. Python and open-source tools like SageMath make it easier to
work on quantum field theory, general relativity, and beyond.

## Main libraries

- [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org) 
    A comprehensive system for algebra, calculus, and numerical analysis. It’s widely used for symbolic computation in physics.
- [Cadabra](https://cadabra.science/index.html) 
    A tool for tensor calculations, especially in general relativity. It simplifies complex tensor equations.
- [EinsteinPy](https://docs.einsteinpy.org/en/latest/user_guide.html) 
    A Python library for general relativity, with tools to work with Einstein’s equations and relativistic phenomena.

## Other libraries

- [PyRate](https://github.com/LSartore/pyrate) 
    - A Python library for the computation of renormalization group equations for general, non-supersymmetric gauge theories.
- [munuSSM](https://gitlab.com/thomas.biekoetter/munussm) 
    - A Python package for studying the phenomenology of the μ-from-ν Supersymmetric Standard Model (μνSSM).
- [Wilson](https://wilson-eft.github.io/) 
    - A framework for effective field theory calculations in lattice gauge theory.
- [Flavio](https://flav-io.github.io/) 
    - A Python library focused on flavor physics, studying mesons and baryons.
- [TorchPhysics](https://boschresearch.github.io/torchphysics/index.html)
    - A Python library of deep learning methods for solving differential equations.
- [PyFeyn](https://pyfeyn2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 
    - A Python library for generating and visualizing Feynman diagrams, used in quantum field theory.
