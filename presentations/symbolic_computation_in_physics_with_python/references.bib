  abstract  = "This detailed yet accessible text provides an essential
               introduction to the advanced mathematical methods at the core of
               theoretical physics. The book steadily develops the key concepts
               required for an understanding of symmetry principles and
               topological structures, such as group theory, differentiable
               manifolds, Riemannian geometry, and Lie algebras. Based on a
               course for senior undergraduate students of physics, it is
               written in a clear, pedagogical style and would also be valuable
               to students in other areas of science and engineering. The
               material has been subject to more than twenty years of feedback
               from students, ensuring that explanations and examples are lucid
               and considered, and numerous worked examples and exercises
               reinforce key concepts and further strengthen readers'
               understanding. This text unites a wide variety of important
               topics that are often scattered across different books, and
               provides a solid platform for more specialized study or
               research.",
